In 1975, she used to work at a hotel in the capital city, where she lived with her two daughters (three and one year old at the time).\n                                                She was freed in November 1976 nearby a sugar cane plantation and from there she walked to the Hospital del Carmen where she was hospitalized until she was able to return home.\n                                                Sara, as expected, lived terrified by the martyrdom that she had to endure. In 2004, thirty years later, through an acquaintance and supported by the human right organization H.I.J.O.S, she contacted the Secretary for Human Rights in Tucuman. In 2006 she contacted the National Secretary for Human Rights, where, at this point, the National Commission for the Right to an Identity (CONADI for its Spanish acronym) became involved. This organization open an investigation into this case and in September 2007 her DNA information was added to the National Genetic Data Bank (BNDG for its Spanish acronym); thus, hoping to locate her son.\n                                                In the meantime, the young son had already started his own search. From an early age, he suspected that he was not the son of those who raise him. Although they never confirmed his doubts, people around him knew the real situation. He had been registered as born in 1977 in the Province of Santa Fe - where he grew up -; however, his doubts increased with the passing of time.\n                                                In February 2015, he got the courage to visit the Rosario Branch of Abuelas who were able to provide him with the necessary assistance and support that they provided to all those who are in search of their origins. From here, he was referred to the CONADI.

","['In October 1976, in Reconquista, province of Santa Fe, a gang composed of police officers, members of the III Air Brigade of Reconquista and other military personnel carried out a raid at the home of a young couple. By brute force, destroying everything, they kidnapped Rubén Maulín, a worker and political activist of the PRT, witnessed by his two young children and his wife Luisa Pratto, pregnant for four months. During the same operation they took Rubén\'s mother, Ana Elena Schoesting and other family members. Luisa was alone with her two children and her pregnancy. Weeks later, her younger sister, Griselda, arrived from Buenos Aires to help her, but she was also kidnapped.\n                                               The Story\nThe oppressors focused their anger on to Luisa who was tortured at her home, in front of her children, as well as raped repeatedly. When she was about to give birth to a local private hospital, on March 26, 1977, Luisa was registered with the name of the appropriator - Cecilia Góngora of Segretin-, evidencing the premeditation of the crime about to be committed by planting proof, at the same time, of the surname that her son would take. The baby was; then, given to a married couple, Jose Angel Segretin and Cecilia Góngora, linked by family ties to the Air Force, and renamed José Luis. His appropriators registered him in the Civil Register with a forged birth certificate, signed by Dr. Elsa Nasatsky de Martino.\n                                               By then, Rubén remained detained but; now, as a political prisoner. These were years of great pain for Luisa. After childbirth, and for a long time, she was continuously visited by the same police gang that had kidnapped her husband and brothers, and subjected to torture and sexual abuse. José Luis\'s grandmother, Ana Elena, took care of the children and accompanied Luisa on her claim for her husband and another kidnapped son. When Rubén Maulín regained his freedom, in 1982, the parents went to demand Justice for the child restitution but did not get a satisfactory response and were told that nothing could be done.\n                                               The Search\nFor a long time, Ruben and Luisa were unaware of their son\'s whereabouts, however, at the end of the \' 80s, a neighbor of the couple brought them information about the place where their son was living. It was thus that they made another claim for him; however, the lack of documentation and the threats by the appropriators prevented them from getting their son back. In the early \' 90s, Gisela, José Luis\' older sister, heard at her school of a child with the surname Segretin and attempted to talk to him, but the meeting did not prosper as Cecilia Góngora threatened Gisela in an effort to hamper the search.\n                                               Jose Luis, by then, already knew that he was not the son of the woman who had raised him, but stories about his origins would vary depending on the circumstances and convenience of the appropriators. From an early age, he had doubts about his identity, not only because of the physical differences, but also he had an older sister, also adopted. At first, he was told that it was the result of an extramarital affair of Segretin, but; then, other versions were given; however, always with inconsistencies.\n                                               In 2008, Luisa and her sister Griselda made another attempt before the courts, telling again what they had experienced during the period of State terrorism. After years of impunity, it was the first time that the Santa Fe justice system agreed to investigate their case. This time, it was already two years that many victims of State terrorism in the region had begun to testify in the ""Air Base cause"". Luisa gave an interview on one of the city\'s radio and her story became known to Jose Luis, who felt motivated to find out about his identity.\n                                               The meeting\nIn January 2009, José Luis took courage and called Luisa to tell her that, according to the descriptions that she had made on the radio interview, he could be her child. They met for the first time in February, and in April, he initiated the legal claim for his identity. Quickly José Luis, Rubén Maulín and Luisa Pratto traveled to Buenos Aires and conducted the study at the National Genetic Data Bank to confirm their link: he was the son who, for 32 years, they had been looking for.\n                                               Jose Luis says that he regained his family and his family regained him. Since 2009, he maintains a close relationship with them and their bond is strengthened day after day.\n                                               \nThe case of José Luis was not among the reports of disappeared children in Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, nor in the new cases which, thanks to the investigations of the CONADI, are being incorporated to the Data Bank. However, it\'s another case of child abduction, concealment and falsification of identity of a baby in the framework of State terrorism, as are the appropriation of our grandsons and granddaughters. Thanks to his courage and of his family, they managed to reconstruct the facts that the genocidal conspirators tried to delete and misrepresent.

At the time of their kidnapping, Iris was three month pregnant. She had called her parents to let them know about her visit, but later cancelled the gathering, and the family never knew what happened to her, her partner, or their grandson that was due to be born in July of 1977. \n                                \nThe Parents\nIris Nélida was born on May 15th, 1952 in the city of Mendoza. She was a sociologist in the Catholic University of Argentina (UCA), and her family and friends called her ""Suzuki"". Enrique was born on June 5th, 1951 and was known as ""Bebé"". Iris started her work with the Peronist Youth Union (JUP) and later shared her involvement with Enrique in the Montoneros organization. There, their fellow activists knew her as ""Tita"", ""Pajarito"" or ""La Gallega"", and him as ""El Lobo"" or ""El Chamaco"". \n                                They were both kidnapped by personnel of the Federal Police in the place where they lived, in the city of Buenos Aires, on the street Tacuari, number 400. They were seen at the clandestine detention center ""Club Atlético"" and, from testimonies of survivors, it was known that Enrique was taken to the ESMA and later returned to CCD Atlético. Iris was in CCD Atlético until May of 1977, until the moment she was taken to the ESMA to give birth. Her fellow captees called her ""la Lobita"". This fact shows the repressive coordination between the Argentine Navy with security forces, in this case with the Federal Police of Argentina. \n                                On the other hand, testimonies of survivors from the ESMA realized that ""Tita"" had given birth to a baby boy in July of 1977, and that she came back to hold him in her arms. The diversity of nicknames and testimonies made it take time to figure out that ""Tita"" and ""la Lobita""- a pregnant kidnapped woman and the other who had given birth in the ESMA- were same person. \n                                \nThe Investigation\nThe report about the pregnancy and forced disappearance of Iris Nélida García had been discovered by her father, Manuel García. At the same time, from Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, thanks to the testimonies of Nilda Orazi and other survivors from the ESMA, knowledge was gathered about a young pregnant woman nicknamed ""la Lobita"", who had been transferred from the clandestine center Club Atético to the ESMA to give birth. But the pieces came together much later.\n                                In 2004, the Conadi started to work figure out the identities of the two women. One of the women was nicknamed ""Tita"" and had been seen by various people freed from CCD Atlético; the other, ""la Lobita"", had been seen in the ESMA.\n                                Apart from the investigation, it could be known that one of the survivors of Iris was ""Tita"", and with that the connection was made between her and the pregnant woman in Atlético. Much later, the identity of her partner became known, and it was discovered that he was not reported as missing. The nickname of Enrique made it possible to establish that iris was ""la Lobita"" seen in the ESMA.\n                                At the end of 2004, a person liberated from the Navy\'s Mechanics School, who had been active in the same area as the couple, was able to identify that the ""Lobo"" and ""la obita"" or ""Tita"" were Enrique Bustamente and Iris Nélida García. From this way, it was possible to include a new case to the National Genetic Data Bank. However, until this moment there were no relatives of Enrique Bustamante to contact, since he was never declared as missing and his parents had already passed away. Recently in 2010, a cousin got close to the Secretary of Human Rights in order to get information about Enrique and was able to make the complaint and add the family to the BNDG.  \n                                It should be noted that both the disappearance of Iris and he appropriation of her son are being tried in court as a part of the crimes committed by the ESMA, a trial that started in 2013 before going to the Oral Court in the Federal Criminal Number 5 of the Federal Capital.\n                                \nThe Search \nFaced with numerous complaints from Abuelas, the subsidiary of Córdoba decided to contact, through their team of approachers, a young boy who presumably was the son of missing people.
