\cf2 The supervillain origin story to beat all origin stories.\
With Phoenix appearing in virtually every minute of this movie and dominating the screen with his memorably creepy turn, "Joker" will cling to you like the aftermath of an unfortunately realistic nightmare.\
Phoenix gives the role a frightening intensity. This actor doesn't favour dilettante distancing. He steps right through the looking glass to become the character he has been staring at.\
Forget the overhyped controversy, Joker is simply stupendous as entertainment and provocation, with a gut-punch performance by Phoenix that puts a horrifically human face on an iconic comic-book villain.\

\cf2 Joker doesn't understand its representation of violence because it doesn't know what to do with its politics, opting instead for a confused aestheticization of anarchy, all incendiary chants and masked malcontents thronging the streets.\
In aping the ambition and prestige of its motley influences, Joker winds up with a bungled understanding of its own relation to violence.\
In a year of mass culture that gave us HBO's excellent "Chernobyl," "Joker" can claim the grimmest depiction of a meltdown.\
The year's biggest disappointment has arrived.\
t's not too much to ask -- and more than just being a scold -- for justification of an exercise that places such a villain front and center, especially when there is so little light or goodness to balance the darkness.}
